# Playwright API Testing Hub
**Features**
- Credential Management: Hardcoded credentials have been replaced with GitHub Secrets, ensuring sensitive information is securely stored and managed.
- Helper Methods: Helper methods have been implemented to streamline credential management, making it easier to update and manage credentials across the framework.
- Environment Variables: Hardcoded URLs have been moved to GitHub environment variables, allowing for easy configuration and customization of test environments without modifying the script directly.
- Workflow Integration: The GitHub Action workflow has been modified to accept credentials and URL from GitHub environment variables, providing greater flexibility and control over test execution.
  
**Limitations**
- The current test report-sharing process could be more efficient due to manual file transfer, leading to potential delays, errors, and difficulty in managing versions.

All the exercises I have used are the challenges that  Alan Richardson created. He owns the demo application used to test the API. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for his efforts in creating these challenges and hosting this site free of cost for all new learners.
