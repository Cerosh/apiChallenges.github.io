# Playwright API Testing Hub
**Features**
- GitHub Secrets Integration: Secured credentials have been migrated from the test scripts to GitHub Secrets. This approach enhances security by avoiding hardcoded sensitive information and leveraging GitHub's built-in secret management capabilities.
- Environment Variables: URL hardcoding has been eliminated by utilizing environment variables for dynamic URL handling. This allows for flexible configuration across different environments without modifying the test code.
- Both credentials and URLs are managed in centralized locations (GitHub Secrets and environment variables), simplifying updates and maintenance. This approach reduces the complexity of test scripts and promotes better configuration management.<br>
**Limitations**
- GitHub Pages Integration: A current limitation is the inability to publish test results to GitHub Pages. This issue prevents the automated generation and sharing of test reports or results, which is critical for visibility and post-test analysis.

All the exercises I have used are the challenges that  Alan Richardson created. He owns the demo application used to test the API. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for his efforts in creating these challenges and hosting this site free of cost for all new learners.
