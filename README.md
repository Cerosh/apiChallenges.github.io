# Playwright API Testing Hub
**Features**
- Workflow Dispatch: Test execution can now be triggered based on user input through the workflow_dispatch feature of GitHub Actions, providing greater flexibility and control over test runs.
- Screen Captures: Upon test failure, screen captures of the relevant UI elements are automatically taken, aiding in identifying and debugging issues.
- Custom Assertions: The framework has been modified to include custom assertions, enhance API and UI testing integration, and provide more precise validation.

All the exercises I have used are the challenges that  Alan Richardson created. He owns the demo application used to test the API. I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for his efforts in creating these challenges and hosting this site free of cost for all new learners.
